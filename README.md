When I took a test in highschool or at university, I 
was sometimes allowed to have "scratch" paper to work with. 

It was paper that wasn't submitted when I finished the test 
-- just paper that I could use to calculate or work out things
on. 

This is my "scratch" project. Bits of code that I sometimes
use to work out little things: how a certain syntax works, 
how a class behaves, and so forth.

I'm attaching the non-license to all part of the code: 
if you should copy this code from the original location
and/or modify it, you are required to REMOVE the original 
license and add one of your own choosing.
